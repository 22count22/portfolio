            <p> considerations such as how to design a website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic. Not only is the web development field exciting and on the forefront of the digital age, but it’s also a growing field. This guide will explain how
                to become a web developer, what skills and education are needed, different career paths, current market trends, and what people can expect as a web developer professional.<br> Front-end developers (also known as client-side development)

            <p>
                use a variety of programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the exterior look and features of a site. Back-end developers use programming languages such as Python and Ruby to design, build and integrate applications
                from front-end development into the back end—in other words, they make the features on the site operate. Individuals with skills in both front- and back-end development are known as “full-stack developers.”
